  WallShots.co is your partner in curating beautiful digital scenes compatible with
  a variety of existing video chat platforms like Zoom and Microsoft Teams.  Our goal is 
  to enable you to share your digital collection in many different ways.  

  WallShots certifies ownership of all NFTs, full stop.  It is of vital 
  importance to maintain provenance in the reproduction of digital 
  items.  Having said that, we believe that restricting all use of NFTs to the original platforms
  is an unnecessary limitation.  So we seek to provide a platform you can trust to protect your
  ownership, while vastly increasing your options for sharing. 

  If you're interested in participating in our beta user group, at no 
  expense to yourself, or you just want to keep up on the latest developments 
  and offers please follow the signup process below.
